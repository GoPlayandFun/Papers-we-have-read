# Papers-we-have-read
This repository is to maintain all the papers and our takes on them.

Following is the basic structure of all directories:

* Each source level directory is the basic field the papers inside it belongs to.
* Each field level directory is the name of the paper it belongs to.
* Inside the field level directory we have the paper itself, mostly in pdf form.
* Along with the paper we have our takes in the directory mostly one or more in the markdown format.
* Each paper will have a note from the reader with the name of the paper, name of the reader, the sequential reading and an overall idea and take from the writer in that order.
* This folder may have other files that might be some cross-refs and ideas to implement.
